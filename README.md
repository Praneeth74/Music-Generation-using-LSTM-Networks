## Generating a Playlist of Music

Firstly, we need to install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt using pip -
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To generate a playlist of music, you can use the following script:

```bash
python model_generate.py [num_songs] [note_count]
```
Replace [num_songs] with number of songs you want to generate
Replace [note_count] with the number of notes or chords to generate in each song
